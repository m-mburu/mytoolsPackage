The goal of mytoolsPackage is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of mytoolsPackage like so:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("m-mburu/mytoolsPackage")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r}
data("iris_data")
my_summary(df = iris,
           by = "Species")
```
